# Dental Practice Patient Recall Automation
## Australia | Healthcare Process Integration

---

### Challenge

A dental practice in Australia was **losing patients due to inconsistent follow-up communication** and manual recall processes. The practice used a cloud-based practice management software for patient records, scheduling, and billing, but had no automated system to ensure patients returned for recommended follow-up appointments.

The administrative team was **manually tracking recall schedules**, leading to:
- **Missed follow-up opportunities** when patients didn't self-schedule return visits
- **Inconsistent patient communication** due to manual oversight
- **Revenue loss** from patients who didn't return for preventive or ongoing treatment
- **Administrative burden** consuming valuable staff time

The technical challenge was significant: **the practice management platform had no direct integrations** with popular automation platforms like Zapier or Make, and **no publicly available API documentation**. This left the practice with seemingly no path to automation.

### Solution

Developed a comprehensive **patient recall automation system** by securing early access to a beta API and implementing a multi-platform integration:

**API Access & Platform Evaluation:**
- **Contacted the software vendor directly** to inquire about API access capabilities
- **Secured early access to their beta RESTful API**, overcoming the integration barrier
- **Evaluated four integration platforms** (Make.com, Zapier, Pabbly, Albato) based on pricing, operation limits, and scalability
- **Selected Make.com** after securing a budget-friendly discount for the client

**Automated Recall System:**
- **Time-triggered automation:** Recall processes activated automatically one day after appointment completion
- **Smart verification:** On-demand appointment checking to verify if patients had already rescheduled before initiating contact
- **Task management integration:** Blue PM used as both task management system and patient appointment database
- **Administrative workflow:** Automated task creation for admin team when no follow-up appointment exists

**Technical Implementation:**
- Custom API integration with beta healthcare software using RESTful endpoints
- Multi-step Make.com workflows with conditional logic for different appointment types
- Real-time patient database synchronization between platforms
- Automated task generation and assignment system

### Results

**Patient Retention:**
- **406 patients successfully recalled** since implementation
- **Comprehensive tracking database** of all patients pending recall
- **Eliminated manual recall oversights** that previously led to lost patients

**Operational Efficiency:**
- **Automated daily recall triggers** replaced manual tracking processes
- **Reduced administrative workload** by eliminating manual recall list management
- **One-month implementation timeline** despite API access delays

**Revenue Impact:**
- **Recovered revenue** from patients who would have otherwise been lost to inconsistent follow-up
- **Proactive patient engagement** supporting preventive care scheduling
- **Improved patient retention rates** through systematic recall processes
